# SLAM hands-on experience

This is the assignments from Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg, Robot Mapping - WS 2013/14, for me serve as primary hands-on experiences on  SLAM.
I focus on Least Square method here.

~

the odom_calib_framework provides the ground true and the odometry data, by using least square in order to reduce the System error.

	1) inverse operation is costly 

2) TODO: no  iteration needed
